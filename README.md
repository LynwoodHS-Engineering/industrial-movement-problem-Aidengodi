# :robot: PLTW VEXCode Assignment Submission Instructions

## ü§ì Overview and Learning Outcomes

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to write, test, and submit code using VEXCode in the context of PLTW (Project Lead The Way) robotics projects. By completing this assignment, you will:

- Practice writing and debugging code in VEXCode.
- Learn how to transfer your code from VEXCode to GitHub for assignment submission.
- Develop skills in documenting and submitting your work in a clear, organized manner.

## üéØ Goal of the Assignment

Write a working program in VEXCode that meets the assignment requirements, then submit your code by creating a new `.py` file in the designated GitHub repository by copying and pasting your code.

## üíª Terms to Know

- **VEXCode**: The programming environment used for VEX robotics platforms.
- **Repository (repo)**: A storage location for your code and related files, typically managed with GitHub.
- **.py file**: A file containing Python code.
- **Commit**: Saving changes to your repository.

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Complete Your Code in VEXCode**
   - Write and test your code in the VEXCode environment to ensure it meets the assignment requirements.

2. **Prepare Your Code for Submission**
   - Select and copy your final code from VEXCode.

3. **Create a New File in GitHub**
   - Go to your assignment repository on GitHub.
   - Click "Add file" and select "Create new file."
   - Name your file according to the assignment instructions (e.g., `assignment1.py`).

4. **Paste and Save Your Code**
   - Paste your copied code into the new `.py` file on GitHub.
   - Add a brief comment at the top with your name and the assignment title.
   - Scroll down and click "Commit new file" to save your submission.

5. **Verify Submission**
   - Double-check that your file appears in the repository and contains the correct code.
